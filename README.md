Hotel reservation system using spring boot and thymeleaf.

This project implements a complex domain model powering a session based wizard form flow to book
a hotel room. The flow simulates a real world application in terms of having a variety
of booking options and business rules. 

Key features include

- Thymeleaf ajax fragments + javascript.
- Google maps API integration
- Responsive CSS with semantic-ui
- Extensive spring mvc tests + mockito.


This project was motivated by another project I created using spring web flow 
https://github.com/mjstewart/hotel-reservations. I wanted
to compare webflow against a native session based solution using existing spring mvc 
constructs.


This project provided the inspiration and use cases to create a thymeleaf extension for manipulating query strings 
which I am currently working on now. This project will become the example used in video tutorials demonstrating the new library
in action.
