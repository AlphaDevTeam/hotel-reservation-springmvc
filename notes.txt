On an incoming request, any methods annotated with @ModelAttribute are called before any controller handler method.
It pre populates the Model with an Address object.

@ModelAttribute("address")
public Address addAddress() {
	return new Address();
}


Springâ€™s @SessionAttributes is used on a controller to designate which model attributes should be stored in the session
@SessionAttributes allows you to do is tell Spring which of your model attributes will also be copied to HttpSession before rendering the view

@Controller
@SessionAttributes("address")
public class MyController {
  ...
}

The flow of execution is
1. invoke all @ModelAttribute methods to add objects to the Model.
2. invoke the actual endpoint handler - the method with @GetMapping
3. After the handler is called, the view is rendered then stuff is added to the Session.
